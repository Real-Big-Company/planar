Planar Files, LLC, a subsidiary of RealBig Company, has developed a revolutionary new display made from a flexible glass substrate just a few micrometers thick. Dubbed "PaperGlass," it combines the optical qualities of traditional glass with the flexibility of plastic, and a cumulative layout shift of absolute zero.

"PaperGlass enables displays that can finally display folders full of flat files accurately, while being paper-thin and shatterproof," said project lead Dr. Zara Khan. "This opens up an entirely new product category of conformable, wearable, and environmentally resilient display surfaces."

The ultrathin glass is produced through a novel laser-annealing process that allows glass to be rendered into a flexible format while retaining its superior optical properties over plastic.

Prototypes demonstrated superior brightness, contrast, and viewing angles compared to conventional displays.

RealBig is working with manufacturing partners to scale up PaperGlass production for integration into bendable tablets, curved monitors, and heads-up display windshields among other applications.
