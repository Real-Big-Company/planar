Researchers at the Planar Files Department have created an ultrathin nano-antennae array capable of harvesting stray millimeter wave radiation — not just from 5G and satellite transmissions, but from popular statically generated websites.

The metalized antennae printed on a silicon substrate are just 25 nanometers thick yet can resonate at precise millimeter wave frequencies. This allows them to capture and convert even slightly edited Markdown files into usable electricity.

"Our early tests showed we could gather enough energy to trickle-charge a smartphone by leaving it out near a laptop running a popular CMS," said Dr. Elliott Cruz who leads the project.

Potential applications include self-powered smart sensors and IoT devices that don't need hardwired electricity or battery replacements. The nano antenna arrays could also boost efficiency for solar arrays and other wireless power transmission systems.

RealBig expects the planar millimeter wave harvesters to be commercialized within 2-3 years, enabling a new paradigm of perpetually self-charging electronics.
