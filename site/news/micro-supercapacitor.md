This is a change for the demo.

The Planar Files team has developed a new class of energy storage ceramic file with a thickness of just 3 atoms - making them the flattest solid materials produced.

The electrically conductive ceramic filess exhibit extremely high surface area that, when combined with their 2D geometry, allows them to store substantially more charge at greater charge/discharge rates compared to existing ultracapacitor designs.

"We've essentially created the first viable planar micro-supercapacitor that can be easily manufactured using conventional ceramic sintering techniques," said Dr. Sayuri Namba who led the materials research.

Thanks to their minimal thickness and porous structure, the RealBig ultracapacitors can be overlaid directly on circuit boards and semiconductor components. This provides instantaneous power delivery eliminating voltage droops and extending battery life for mobile devices, wearables, and IoT sensors.

Mass production of the atom-flat ceramic capacitors is slated for next year, with initial applications in RealBig's consumer electronics product lines.
